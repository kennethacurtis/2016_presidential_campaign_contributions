# Summary

For this analysis, my goal was to investigate the flow of money in the 2016
presidential election. First, I discovered that Hillary Clinton received the
most money in the campagin compared to all of the candidates, with Berney
Sanders, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump coming in behind her.

I then wanted to explore which candidates received high dollar and low dollar donations
and made scatter plots that showed the distribution of donations for each candidate.
Hillary Clinton received a great number of the high dollar donations, while Sanders,
Cruz, and Trump received a high amount of low dollar donations. According to
[an article by the Wall Street Journal](http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/fec-donor-data/),
these types of contributions are important for candidates, as they show signs of
a "grassroots enthusiasm".

After seeing the types of donations each candidate was receiving, I looked at who
these donations were coming from. All of Clinton's donations that were over $1
million came from the [Hillary Victory Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Victory_Fund).
This source of money for the Cinton campaign turned out
[to be controversial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democratic-party-fundraising-effort-helps-clinton-find-new-donors-too/2016/02/19/b8535cea-d68f-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html?utm_term=.408ee9aeb4c1) as it
was being accused of operating illegaly and money laundering. Nevertheless, the fund enabled
Clinton to have the most money compared to all of the other candidates. Another notable donor
was [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/about). This organization is a nonprofit that builds
fundraising technology for the left. They donated to Sanders over 15 thousand times in the 2016
campaign and did not donate to any other candidate in this data set. According to [opensecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00401224&cycle=2016),
ActBlue spent $645.3 million for the 2016 election.

Finally, I used the data to explore which cities and occupations are donating to each
candidate. Overall, donors who were retired gave the most money, and New York was the
top city. Hillary Clinton led in all of these categories, but Cruz and Trump had significant
donations from cities in Texas.
